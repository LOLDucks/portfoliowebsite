  <summary>3D Printer Upgrade - Klipper on CR-10</summary>
    <div class="details-content">

        <p>
          I upgraded my Creality CR-10 by installing <strong>Klipper firmware</strong> to achieve faster, more stable, and more precise prints.
          The control system is based on a <strong>BIGTREETECH SKR Mini E3 V3.0</strong> board and a <strong>Raspberry Pi 5</strong>,
          with web-based management via <strong>Fluidd</strong>, which also supports live webcam streaming.
        </p>

        <h3>Main Modifications:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Replaced mainboard with <strong>BIGTREETECH SKR Mini E3 V3.0</strong></li>
          <li>Added <strong>Raspberry Pi 5</strong> for remote management through Fluidd and Klipper</li>
          <li>Installed external power supply and fans for improved cooling</li>
          <li>Repurposed a plastic box as a custom control unit: removed original display, ensured proper airflow, and installed BTT board</li>
          <li>Added second motor for the Z-axis</li>
          <li>Reinforced the frame and added anti-vibration feet</li>
          <li>Modified extruder and cooling fan</li>
          <li>Integrated <strong>BLTouch</strong> for auto bed leveling</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why this project:</h3>
        <p>
          The goal was to create a quieter, faster, and modular machine, perfect for rapid prototyping.
          This upgrade also gave me the opportunity to deepen my knowledge of Klipper, GPIO pin management,
          and interfacing between microcontroller and Raspberry Pi.
        </p>

        <h3>Challenges Faced:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Firmware flashing issues: Windows added hidden folders to the SD card that broke the update. Solved using Linux to clean the card.</li>
          <li>Lack of compatible cables: hand-built custom wiring with crimping and soldering.</li>
        </ul>

    <summary>Pentest GPT - Custom ChatGPT for CTF & Penetration Testing</summary>
    <div class="details-content">
      
      <p>
        This project is a customized version of ChatGPT, designed specifically to assist with <strong>penetration testing, Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, and debugging</strong>.
        It's tailored for intermediate users aiming to boost their efficiency, autonomy, and practical understanding.
      </p>

      <h3>Main Features:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Follows a strict, minimalist workflow: no unnecessary text, no skipped steps</li>
        <li>Explains every command clearly, but only when needed</li>
        <li>Waits for user confirmation before proceeding to the next step</li>
        <li>Maintains session state and avoids repetition</li>
        <li>Always provides official sources (CVE, docs, articles) for exploits and tools</li>
        <li>Operates under the assumption of a Kali Linux / VirtualBox setup</li>
        <li>Supports OSINT, password list generation, scan strategy, and live debugging</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why this project:</h3>
      <p>
        I built this GPT to support my daily workflow in CTF and real-world pentests.
        It helps structure actions, maintain context, and reduce the mental load during complex engagements—while still requiring full user control over the process.
